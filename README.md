# patricks-webpage-portfolio

Hello! As you can tell, my name is Patrick Etienne and I have created this repository for my week 2 Challenge in my UM Coding BootCamp.
This week, my objective is to create a portfolio that showcases my capabilities and previous work experiences to potential employers.
This is a project I will be revisiting in the future. This week, I'll be uploading a picture of my self, some links that direct the user around the page,
as well as some pseudo projects to make the webpage look presentable.
I am excited to share this with those who are interested!
