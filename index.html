                    <p>
                            Hello, thanks for visiting my Portfolio! If you couldn't already tell, my name is Patrick Etienne, it's a pleasure to meet you! 
                        I was born in Kendall, Florida and raised in Hollywood of the same state. I am a man of many passions but the medium that has stolen my heart is my love for art!
                        Specifically graphic design, fashion, music, video games, videography, photography and more, the list goes on and on. My greatest influences definietly come from Japanese Style art.
                        I could ramble all day about how their culture has pioneered design as we know it in media all across the world but we'll save that for another day!
                        Besides my love for the art, I definetly having fun in what ever form it takes place. 
                        Whether it be going outside and enjoying all the gifts that life has to give ir simply spening time with my friends, I'm down for it 100%!
                        My favorite thing to do by far is to create though. It stimulates my mind and the pay off is a feeling that can't be replaced! 
                            Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope it was able to paint a picture of my character and spark an interest for our future collaborations together! 
                    </p>

                        Believe it or not, this webpage, hosting my Portfolio IS my very first and only project as a coder & web designer!
                        As a kid, I used to create rom hacks of my favorite Nintendo games using software that allowed me to do so, but they were heavily GUI based and didn't involve complex coding!
